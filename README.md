**Note:** This repo has been archived and will no longer maintained. The original locast.py python script is outdated. See `new_api_details/` for an updated API example (working as of March 2021). I've also integrated the new API into my custom HTPC client where any future updates will occur: https://github.com/vesche/chillchamber/blob/master/chillchamber/apps/locast.py
